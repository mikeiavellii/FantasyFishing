        Adjust your depth using the Slider Bar and click the 'Cast Line' button
        when you're ready to fish!<br />
        Sometimes the fish just aren't biting and that's ok! When you do make a
        catch, you can either keep it by adding it to your Caught List and sell
        it, or release it. You can also purchase upgrades for your tools and buy a
        special potion to clean up the waters.<br />
        Your Caught List can be viewed by clicking the 'User' page above. Here you
        will find a Leaderboard of all fishers and the Trophies you've earned so
        keep fishing in the All Blue and don't forget to check your profile often
        to see if you've earned anything new!
        <br> <br>
        Be sure to head over to the music page to put on some tunes while you're fishing.
      
      <p>Happy Fishing!</p>
